# API React Deploy Demo

This is the API that belongs to the demo about deploying a React app as separate client and back-end. You need to create a .env file with the following variable:
```
client=originWhereYourClientIsHostedOn
```

Note that your application probably also has a mongodb database connected to it. The database is could be hosted on Atlas. The connection string for this database would in that case also be in your .env file, like all other environment dependend variables and all confidential information.
